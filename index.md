## Introduction
This lesson will walk you through how to quickly create maps using google maps and google fusion tables. 
For this example, we will be mapping earthquakes in Oklahoma from 2015.

## Downloading the Data
For this exercise, you will need to create a Google account If you do not already have one. You can create an account at https://accounts.google.com/SignUp.

Today, we will use multiple tools to map Oklahoma earthquake data from 2010 and 2015. First, we need to download our data. We will use comma-separated values (CSV) files made available by the Oklahoma Geological Survey. 

First, navigate to the OGSâ€™s website (http://www.ou.edu/ogs). In the navigation bar on the left side, click Earthquake Catalogs. This will take you to the list of available data. Click on 2015 and download the 2015.csv file. Repeat for the 2010 dataset. 

Examine the data. Some of the headers may make sense to you. Some may not. If you collapse the Earthquake Catalogs on the OGS website, you can click on Catalog Header Descriptions to see a description of each of the headers.  

*If this was your data, would you want to do any clean up work on it?*

## Google Maps

Now that we have our data, we can start making our map! Go to http://google.com/mymaps
Click Create a New Map. If you are not already signed into your Google account, this will take you to a log in page. Please sign into your account. 

You should now see a map of the United States (Google base map), search bar with icons across the top, and a white box (Mapbox) on the upper left. See image below.
